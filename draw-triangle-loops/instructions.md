### loops

Complete the `drawTriangle()` function in script.js that draws a triangle with asterisks (*) based on the `triangleSize` parameter.

Ex: `drawTriangle(4)` outputs to the console a triangle with `triangleSize` 4, so the longest side (4 asterisks) appears on the bottom line:

```
*
**
***
****
```

Hint: Use a loop inside a loop to complete `drawTriangle()`. The outer loop is responsible for outputting each asterisk line, and the inner loop is responsible for building the asterisk line with the appropriate length by concatenating asterisks to a single string.

To test the JavaScript in your web browser, call `drawTriangle()` from the JavaScript console.
